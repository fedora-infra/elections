""" This is an example pkgdb configuration for fedmsg.
By convention, it is normally installed as ``/etc/fedmsg.d/pkgdb.py``

For Fedora Infrastructure, our own version of this file is kept in
``puppet/modules/fedmsg/templates/fedmsg.d/``

It needs to be globally available so remote consumers know how to find the
pkgdb producer (wsgi process).
